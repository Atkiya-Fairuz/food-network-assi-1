                <p>This is Atkiya Fairuz,I'm a student of Eastern University.I think, Eating a healthy, balanced diet
                    doesn't need to be complicatedâ€”or restrictive. Start by choosing a variety of foods from
                    all the major food groups, including fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, dairy products, grains
                    and cereals, and good
                    oils and fats.</p><br>
