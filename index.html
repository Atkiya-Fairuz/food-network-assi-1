                    doesn't need to be complicatedâ€”or restrictive. Start by choosing a variety of foods from
                    all the major food groups, including fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, dairy products, grains
                    and cereals, and good

        <p>A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no processed food
            or
            sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and
            animal-based
            foods, although a non-plant source of vitamin B12 is needed for those following a vegan diet. Various
            nutrition guides
            are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating
            to be
            healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between
            foods based on
            the components relevant to health.<span class="message-title">If you want to know more about healthy recipe
